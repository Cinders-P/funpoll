# FUNPOLL

See it in action: https://funpoll.herokuapp.com/


This voting app is the first full stack basejump at Free Code Camp. Much more difficult than the last assignments.

The __app__ folder holds our models (for login) and routes (for accessing the site).
A __config__ folder holds all the user-sensitive scripts for authentication.
The __views__ folder holds the .pug (html) that will be rendered to the user.

The server.js sets everything up, and the Procfile is for heroku to tell it to run server.js when starting the app.

NPM packages used:
* mongodb
* mongoose
* passport
* express
* pug
* stylus
& some others
