# FUNPOLL

This voting app is the first full stack basejump at Free Code Camp.

The __app__ folder holds our models (for login) and routes (for accessing the site).
A __config__ folder holds all the user-sensitive scripts for authentication.
The __views__ folder holds the .pug (html) and .styl (css) files that will be rendered to the user, along with any client-side JS.

The server.js sets everything up, and the Procfile is for heroku to tell it to run server.js when starting the app.

NPM packages used:
* mongodb
* mongoose
* passport
* express
* pug
* stylus
& some others
